# Survive
 An Android app designed to be used in survival situtations (assuming Internet connection is unavailable).

## Features
* Compass / GPS
* Local weather (barometer, sunrise/sunset, moon phase)
* Flashlight / strobe

## Navigation
The compass can be used to determine the direction to geomagnetic North, and when combined with the GPS it can be used to navigate to predefined locations. The predefined locations, known as beacons, can be created while at a location and at any point you can use the compass to navigate back to where the beacon was placed. While there is an Internet connection, beacons can also be placed on a map (not present yet).

Example beacons: home, work, trailhead, campsite

## Weather
The barometer can be used to determine if the weather will change soon and if a storm is likely to occur. The barometric pressure history is displayed as a graph and an interpretation of the current reading is shown. If the pressure suddenly drops, a storm alert notification is sent. The sunrise and sunset times are also displayed as well as the current moon phase.  

## Flashlight
