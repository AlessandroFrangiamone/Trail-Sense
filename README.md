# Survive
 An Android app designed to be used in survival situtations (assuming Internet connection is unavailable).

## Features
* Compass / GPS
* Flashlight / strobe
* "Blueprints" for various survival tools / chemicals

## Navigation
The compass can be used to determine the direction to geomagnetic North, and when combined with the GPS it can be used to navigate to predefined locations. The predefined locations, known as beacons, can be created while at a location and at any point you can use the compass to navigate back to where the beacon was placed. While there is an Internet connection, beacons can also be placed on a map.

Example beacons: home, work, trailhead, campsite

## Flashlight
