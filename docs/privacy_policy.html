        <h2>Trail Sense - Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Location information gathered by this application does not leave your
          device (as a matter of fact, this app doesn't use the Internet at
          all). The altitude and pressure history for the last 48 hours is
          stored in local app storage - this is used to determine weather
          forecasts. The last known location is also stored in app preferences
          to allow faster load times and support app functionality when the GPS
          can not be reached. The beacons store their location in a local SQLite
          database. All of this information is cleared when you clear the app
          storage or delete it.

        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">48 hours of altitude history</span>: When background location is enabled and the monitor weather setting is on. This is used for sea level calibration of barometer data.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Your last location</span>: This is used as a cache for your location when you either don't have a GPS signal or when the GPS fix is taking too long.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Beacon information</span>: The coordinates and other information for the beacons you create are stored on your device, so you can navigate to them in the future.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Background Location</span>: Used for barometer altitude correction and sunset alerts.
