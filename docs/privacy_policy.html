        <p class="bold">Last Updated January 1, 2020</p>
        <p>
          This is the Privacy Policy of Trail Sense. Trail Sense is an Android
          app which uses your phone's sensors to assist with wilderness treks or
          survival situations. This Privacy Policy describes all the sensitive
          data in which Trail Sense uses (does not collect or share), including,
          but not limited to location and background location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location information gathered by this application does not leave your
          device (as a matter of fact, this app doesn't use the Internet at
          all). The altitude and pressure history for the last 48 hours is
          stored in local app storage - this is used to determine weather
          forecasts. The last known location is also stored in app preferences
          to allow faster load times and support app functionality when the GPS
          can not be reached. The beacons store their location in a local SQLite
          database. All of this information is cleared when you clear the app
          storage or delete it.
        </p>
        <h3>Data collection / storage</h3>
        <p>
          Trail Sense does not collect or share any user information outside of
          the app itself. All data stored by Trail Sense is done locally on your
          device.
        </p>
        <h3>Data retention</h3>
        <p>
          All data (which is stored on your device) is cleared when you clear
          the cache/storage of the application.
        </p>
        <h3>Location and background location</h3>
        <p>
          Trail Sense uses location data for navigation, barometer calibration,
          and astronomy calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">48 hours of altitude history</span>: When
          background location is enabled and the monitor weather setting is on.
          This is used for sea level calibration of barometer data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Your last location</span>: This is used as a cache
          for your location when you either don't have a GPS signal or when the
          GPS fix is taking too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Beacon information</span>: The coordinates and
          other information for the beacons you create are stored on your
          device, so you can navigate to them in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Location</span>: Used for beacon navigation, True
            North, barometer altitude correction (in background), and sun/moon
            rise/set times
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Background Location</span>: Used for barometer
            altitude correction and sunset alerts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Flashlight</span>: Used for the flashlight/SOS
            feature - available on the navigation tab.
