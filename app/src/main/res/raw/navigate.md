## How to trace back your steps (Backtrack)?

Backtrack can be used to record waypoints while hiking, and if lost you can navigate back to your last known position without needing to set up beacons or paths before hiking.

You can enable Backtrack by opening 'Paths' from the 'Tools' tab. Once on the Paths page, you can click the start button in the bottom right to turn it on. It will stay on until you disable it by clicking the same button. You can change the waypoint placing interval in Trail Sense Settings > Navigation.

The Backtrack path is available on the Paths tool - by default its name reflects the start and end time of the recording.

From the path menu, you will have the option to keep a path forever, which you might want to choose if you need the backtrack path around for more than a few days (configurable in Navigation settings).

## How to import paths?

You can import a path by opening the 'Paths' tool and clicking the 3-dot menu icon at the top right, then select 'Import GPX'. Paths must be in GPX format and correspond to a GPX track / segment - waypoints can't be imported from this screen (they correspond to beacons). On import the path will automatically be simplified (high quality) to prevent out of memory issues (this can be disabled in Trail Sense Settings > Navigation). 

## How to navigate with a path?

Once you have a path created, you can open it from the Paths tool. Opening a path will show you a map that you can use to navigate. You can also change the line color and style to more easily distinguish paths. Changing the point style will allow you to visualize information such as cell signal strength, time, and elevation - this will only be shown on the path overview page.

To estimate path difficulty, Trial Sense displays a difficulty rating which factors in the distance and elevation gain of the path. You can further use the key figures of the path to see elevation gain/loss, distance, and estimated duration. There is also an elevation chart which can be used, that plots elevation vs path distance.

Paths will show up on the nearby radar compass if it is enabled, which allows you to see paths directly from the Navigation tab. All new paths will be visible, but you can change this by selecting "Hide" or "Show" from the path's menu.

If you would prefer to navigate to a specific point on the path, you can either view all points or tap a point on the path map. This will select the point and allow you to open the point's menu where you can either navigate to it or create a beacon for future reference.
