## When and where to create beacons?

It is best to enter beacons into Trail Sense while you still have Internet, so you can use the beacons to navigate while on the trail. Do this by sharing a location from a map app in Trail Sense, or by manually entering the coordinates.

It is best to place beacons on prominent features or forks in the trail. Adding a comment may be helpful if you need to follow a trail of beacons back.

You can also place beacons at your current location while on the trail to mark points of interest that you may want to revisit. If you need to wander off the trail, place a beacon at the location where you left the trail - you can always navigate back there if you get lost.

## How to navigate using beacons?

When navigating to a beacon, head in its general direction (routing around obstacles or staying on the trail). You can navigate either by using the nearby feature or by selecting the beacon as a destination on the beacon list screen (recommended).

## How to create beacons?

You can follow these steps to create a beacon, with the exception of creating a beacon from a maps application - for that you will start by opening the maps app and sharing a location to Trail Sense.

1. On the navigation tab, click the navigation button (bottom right corner)
2. Click the create beacon button (bottom right corner)
3. Click "Beacon"
4. Enter the name of the beacon (of your choosing)
5. Enter the latitude or longitude (see below)
6. Optionally add the beacon to an existing group
7. Enter the elevation or notes (optional)
8. Click the done button (this only appears when a valid name and location are entered)

### From your current location

On the drop beacon page, you can click the orange GPS icon next to the location field to drop a beacon at your current location.

### From a known latitude and longitude

On the drop beacon page, you can enter the latitude and longitude of a known location. The supported formats are decimal degrees (ex. -77.508333), degrees decimal minutes (ex. 77°30.5' S), degrees minutes seconds (ex. 77°30'29.9988" S), UTM (ex. 19T 0414639E 4428236N), and MGRS (ex. 19TDE 14640 28236). Only the English cardinal directions are supported (ex. N E S W).

See the 'Using printed maps' guide for details on how to get a location from a map.

### From a map application

Some map applications allow you to share a location on the map in latitude, longitude format (may be shown as a "geo:" share option). If you share a location and Trail Sense appears in the share options, it will then open the drop beacon tab with the latitude and longitude prefilled.

Unfortunately, Google Maps does not allow sharing location to other apps (it instead shares a link to Google Maps, which Trail Sense can't get latitude and longitude from). A workaround in Google Maps is to find the location you want to create a beacon at, then put your phone into airplane mode. You can then tap and hold the location in Google Maps to place a marker. The title of the marker is the latitude and longitude which you can manually enter into Trail Sense.

### At a distance

To place a beacon a known distance and direction from a location, you can fill out the latitude and longitude fields (the starting location), then toggle the "Create at distance" field on. You will then need to enter the distance away and set the direction to the new location before you can save the beacon. The new beacon will be placed at the distance and direction away from the latitude and longitude entered.

## How to see nearby beacons?

Seeing nearby beacons gives you more reference points to locate your current position and navigate easier.

To enable Nearby, open the Navigation settings and turn on 'Show nearby beacons'. You can choose how many beacons you want visible at once, and how far away beacons are considered to be nearby. You can also enable the radar compass, which visualizes the distance to nearby beacons on the background of the compass, like radar.

The radar compass is recommended, as you can easily see how close you are to various nearby beacons, which makes navigation easier.

## How to trace back your steps (Backtrack)?

Backtrack can be used to record waypoints while hiking, and if lost you can navigate back to your last known position without needing to set up beacons before hiking.

You can enable Backtrack by opening it from the 'Tools' tab. Once on the Backtrack page, you can click the start button in the bottom right to turn it on. It will stay on until you disable it by clicking the same button. You can change the waypoint placing interval in Trail Sense Settings > Tools.

On the Backtrack screen, you should see a list of waypoints, which represent your position at a specific time. From there, you can tap on a waypoint to start navigation, or you can click the menu button to either create a beacon from it or delete it. It is recommended that you create a beacon from the waypoint and use that to navigate, as waypoints will only be available for 2 days before being deleted forever.

Backtrack also shows your cell phone signal strength at time and location of the waypoint, learn more about that on the 'Signaling for help' guide.

If you have the nearby radar compass enabled, you can show the Backtrack path to more easily follow the path. It currently fades away after 3 hours. Using the "Arrow" path style will show the path in arrows pointing backward in time, following the arrows will retrace your steps.

## How to follow a bearing?

From the 'Navigation' tab, you can quickly set a bearing reference by tapping the compass. This will place a marker on the compass which always points in the same direction, regardless of your location. You can use this if you know you need to travel in a direction, but don't know how far you need to go (ex. travel North). Tapping the compass again will remove the bearing.
