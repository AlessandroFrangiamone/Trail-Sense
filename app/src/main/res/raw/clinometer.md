A clinometer is a tool for measuring angles. It can be used to estimate object heights, steepness, and avalanche risk. A clinometer will read -90° when pointed straight down, 0° when flat, and 90° when pointed straight up. In addition to a degree value, a percentage is shown to indicate how steep a slope is.

You can use the Clinometer tool in Trail Sense to measure angles - just hold your phone vertically and use the side (where the volume and power buttons are normally located) of your phone to sight. You can also tap the camera icon in the top left to sight using your camera - align using the line in the center of the viewfinder. Tapping anywhere on the screen will lock the clinometer and tapping again will unlock it.

## Estimate the height of an object

The height of an object can be measured if the distance to the object is known. This is typically done determine how tall a tree is.

1. Open the Clinometer tool
2. Tap the ruler icon in the top right
3. Align the clinometer to the base of the target
4. Tap the screen and hold
5. Realign the clinometer to the top of the target
6. Release to lock and see the height of the target

## Estimate the distance to an object

The distance to an object can be measured if the height of that object is known. Although, if you have a reference, it is possible to measure the distance to an object of unknown height. To do this, enter your height and stand next to the object. Mark your height on the object, then follow the steps to estimate distance - but only measure up to the where you marked, rather than the top of the object.

1. Open the Clinometer tool
2. Tap the ruler icon in the top right
3. Align the clinometer to the base of the target
4. Tap the screen and hold
5. Realign the clinometer to the top of the target
6. Release to lock and see the distance to the target


## Determining avalanche risk

Most avalanches occur on slopes between 30° (57%) and 45° (100%). You can use the Clinometer tool in Trail Sense to measure the angle. Just align it to the top of the slope and tap the screen to lock it in. You can then read the avalanche risk. Alternatively, you could use the color bands on the clinometer dial; the red band indicates high avalance risk.

Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if a slope has avalanche potential, which is limited by your phone's sensors. If you think a slope is unsafe, then try to find an alternate route to avoid it or take precautions.
