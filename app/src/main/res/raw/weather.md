## Understanding pressure

A general rule is that air pressure will drop as a storm moves in. Trail Sense uses this to determine if the weather is going to worsen. A rapid drop in pressure could indicate a fast moving storm. Air pressure also changes when you change elevation - this affects the accuracy of weather forecasts in Trail Sense.

## Improving forecast accuracy

- Stay at the same elevation for 1 or more hours for Trail Sense to produce a more accurate forecast
- Enable "sea level pressure" in the barometer settings
- Use Trail Sense's prediction along with things you can sense to determine if a storm is moving in
- Increasing winds, darkening skies, rapid temperature/humidity changes or abnormal animal behavior could indicate a storm

## Predicting weather using clouds

Trail Sense can be used to track clouds throughout the day. You can do this by opening the Cloud tool and logging a new cloud. If you know what cloud type you are looking at, you can choose Manual and select the cloud you see. Selecting the other two options will allow you to scan a cloud using your camera or a photo. Trail Sense will automatically select the most likely clouds in the photo. Some clouds are flagged as experimental due to low detection accuracy. Clicking on a cloud in the log will give you more details including a description, forecast, and associated precipitation. If you notice that cloud cover is increasing, or clouds are getting darker it may be a sign that a storm is on the way.

## Estimating the temperature

Trail Sense uses your phone's built in thermometer to get temperature (see the guide on how to calibrate your thermometer). You can also use Trail Sense to estimate the temperature at a different elevation. Do this by open the thermometer tool and clicking the elevation icon in the upper right. You can autofill your current elevation and temperature, or enter them all manually. The destination elevation field is the elevation where you want to estimate the temperature while the base elevation/temperature is at your current location (or location of the temperature reading). Once all three fields are entered, the estimated temperature at the destination will display.

## Use common sense

Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if bad weather is approaching, which is limited by your phone's sensors. If you think a storm is coming, seek shelter regardless of what Trail Sense says.
