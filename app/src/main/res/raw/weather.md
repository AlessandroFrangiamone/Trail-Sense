## Understanding pressure
A general rule is that air pressure will drop as a storm moves in. Trail Sense uses this to determine if the weather is going to worsen. A rapid drop in pressure could indicate a fast moving storm. Air pressure also changes when you change altitude - this affects the accuracy of weather forecasts in Trail Sense.

## Improving forecast accuracy
- Stay at the same altitude for 1 or more hours for Trail Sense to produce a more accurate forecast
- Enable "sea level pressure" in the barometer settings
- Use Trail Sense's prediction along with things you can sense to determine if a storm is moving in
- Increasing winds, darkening skies, rapid temperature/humidity changes or abnormal animal behavior could indicate a storm

## Use common sense
Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if bad weather is approaching, which is limited by your phone's sensors. If you think a storm is coming, seek shelter regardless of what Trail Sense says.
