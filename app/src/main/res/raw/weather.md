## Understanding pressure

When a storm is coming, the air pressure will likely drop. Trail Sense uses this to know if the weather is going to get worse. Air pressure also changes when you change elevation, so if you're hiking in the mountains, Trail Sense's forecasts might not be as accurate.

## Improving forecast accuracy

To get a more accurate forecast from Trail Sense, stay at the same elevation for 1 or more hours. You can also enable "sea level pressure" in the barometer settings. In addition, you can log the clouds and Trail Sense will use that in addition. If the clouds are getting darker or more numerous, it could mean a storm is coming.

## Predicting weather using clouds

Trail Sense can help you track the clouds throughout the day. To use it, you can open the Clouds tool and log a new cloud. If you know what type of cloud you're looking at, you can choose Manual and select it. If not, you can use your camera or a photo to scan the cloud and Trail Sense will automatically identify it for you. For best results, use a photo that only has clouds and the sky in it. Some clouds may be marked as experimental because they're harder to identify. If you click on a cloud in the log, you'll get more information about it, including a description, forecast, and whether it's likely to bring precipitation.

## Estimating the temperature

Trail Sense uses modified historical data from 1991 to 2020 to estimate the temperature for your location and time of year. It can also be used to see what the temperature will be at a different elevation. To do this, you open the Temperature Estimation tool and enter your current location's elevation and temperature. You can type it in or use the Autofill button. Then you enter the elevation of the place you want to know the temperature at (like the top of a mountain) and it will give you an estimate. Alternatively, you can use the Climate tool to see what the historic temperature is for a given location and time of year.

Keep in mind that this is just an estimate and the actual temperature might be different because of the current weather.

## Use common sense

Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if bad weather is approaching. However, if you think a storm is coming, it's always best to use common sense and seek shelter regardless of what Trail Sense says.
