## Understanding pressure

A general rule is that air pressure will drop as a storm moves in. Trail Sense uses this to determine if the weather is going to worsen. A rapid drop in pressure could indicate a fast moving storm. Air pressure also changes when you change elevation - this affects the accuracy of weather forecasts in Trail Sense.

## Improving forecast accuracy

- Stay at the same elevation for 1 or more hours for Trail Sense to produce a more accurate forecast
- Enable "sea level pressure" in the barometer settings
- Supplement the weather monitor by logging cloud conditions over time
- Use Trail Sense's prediction along with things you can sense to determine if a storm is moving in
- Increasing winds, darkening skies, rapid temperature/humidity changes or abnormal animal behavior could indicate a storm

## Predicting weather using clouds

Trail Sense can help you track the clouds throughout the day. To use it, you can open the Clouds tool and log a new cloud. If you know what type of cloud you're looking at, you can choose Manual and select it. If not, you can use your camera or a photo to scan the cloud and Trail Sense will automatically identify it for you. For best results, use a photo that only has clouds and the sky in it. Some clouds may be marked as experimental because they're harder to identify. If you click on a cloud in the log, you'll get more information about it, including a description, forecast, and whether it's likely to bring precipitation. If you notice that the clouds are getting darker or more numerous, that could be a sign that a storm is coming.

## Estimating the temperature

Trail Sense uses historical data from the past 60 years to estimate the temperature for your location and time of year. It can also be used to see what the temperature will be at a different elevation. To do this, you open the Temperature Estimation tool and enter your current location's elevation and temperature. You can type it in or use the Autofill button. Then you enter the elevation of the place you want to know the temperature at (like the top of a mountain) and it will give you an estimate. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate and the actual temperature might be different because of the current weather.

## Use common sense

Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if bad weather is approaching, which is limited by your phone's sensors. If you think a storm is coming, seek shelter regardless of what Trail Sense says.
