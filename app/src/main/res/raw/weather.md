## Weather prediction capabilities of Trail Sense
Trail Sense can give a rough prediction of the weather using your device's sensors. The prediction is a best guess, and may not be accurate.

On some devices, the Weather tool may not be available. This is due to the device not having a barometer sensor, which measures air pressure.

## Understanding pressure

As a general rule, air pressure drops as a storm approaches. But pressure also changes when you change elevation, so if you're hiking in the mountains, Trail Sense's forecasts might not be as accurate.

## Improving forecast accuracy

- Stay at the same elevation for at least an hour for a more accurate forecast.
- Enable "sea level pressure" in the barometer settings.
- Log clouds using the Clouds tool.
- Use Trail Sense's prediction along with observable signs such as increasing winds, darkening skies, sudden temperature/humidity changes, or abnormal animal behavior to gauge approaching storms.

## Predicting weather using clouds

Trail Sense helps track clouds during the day. Open the Clouds tool and log a new cloud. You can identify the cloud type manually or by using a photo. For best results, use a photo that shows only clouds and the sky. Some clouds may be labeled as "experimental" if they are harder to identify. If you click on a cloud in the log, you'll get more information about it, including a description, forecast, and likelihood of precipitation.

## Estimating the temperature

Trail Sense estimates temperature using historical data from 1991 to 2020. It can also estimate temperature at different elevations. Open the Temperature Estimation tool, enter your location's elevation and temperature, and then the desired elevation for temperature estimation.

Keep in mind that this is just an estimate and the actual temperature might be different because of the current weather.

## Use common sense

Trail Sense provides general guidelines, but trust your instincts. Seek shelter if you sense a storm approaching, regardless of Trail Sense's prediction.
