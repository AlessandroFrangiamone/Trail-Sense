## Understanding pressure

A general rule is that air pressure will drop as a storm moves in. Trail Sense uses this to determine if the weather is going to worsen. A rapid drop in pressure could indicate a fast moving storm. Air pressure also changes when you change elevation - this affects the accuracy of weather forecasts in Trail Sense.

## Improving forecast accuracy

- Stay at the same elevation for 1 or more hours for Trail Sense to produce a more accurate forecast
- Enable "sea level pressure" in the barometer settings
- Supplement the weather monitor by logging cloud conditions over time
- Use Trail Sense's prediction along with things you can sense to determine if a storm is moving in
- Increasing winds, darkening skies, rapid temperature/humidity changes or abnormal animal behavior could indicate a storm

## Predicting weather using clouds

Trail Sense can be used to track clouds throughout the day. You can do this by opening the Cloud tool and logging a new cloud. If you know what cloud type you are looking at, you can choose Manual and select the cloud you see. Selecting the other two options will allow you to scan a cloud using your camera or a photo. Trail Sense will automatically select the most likely clouds in the photo. For best results, use a photo that contains just clouds and the sky. Some clouds are flagged as experimental due to low detection accuracy. Clicking on a cloud in the log will give you more details including a description, forecast, and associated precipitation. If you notice that cloud cover is increasing, or clouds are getting darker it may be a sign that a storm is on the way.

## Estimating the temperature

Trail Sense uses historical data from the past 60 years to estimate the temperature for your location and time of year. It can also be used to estimate the temperature at a different elevation. You can do this by opening the Temperature Estimation tool. Start by entering your current (base) elevation and temperature, either by manually entering them or using the Autofill button. Next, enter the destination elevation (ex. the top of a mountain) to see what the temperature will be at that elevation. Please note, that this is just an estimation and the actual temperature my vary based on current weather conditions.

## Use common sense

Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if bad weather is approaching, which is limited by your phone's sensors. If you think a storm is coming, seek shelter regardless of what Trail Sense says.
