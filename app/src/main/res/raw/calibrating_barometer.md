To calibrate your barometer, go to Trail Sense Settings > Sensors > Barometer and turn on sea level pressure.

## Smoothing
To reduce noise in pressure readings, increase the smoothing setting. A value of around 15% is recommended. However, if you increase the smoothing too much, Trail Sense may ignore real pressure changes.

## Factor in temperature
To get a more accurate pressure reading, factor in the temperature. This will make the reading more prone to noise from your phone's thermometer, but it will also give you a more accurate reading of the actual air pressure.
