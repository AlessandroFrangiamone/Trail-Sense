To calibrate your barometer to sea level, first open the barometer settings (Trail Sense Settings > Barometer and thermometer), then enable sea level pressure. Also, ensure that your altimeter is properly calibrated (Trail Sense Settings > Altimeter), as incorrect altitudes will cause incorrect sea level conversions. If you notice false readings (which appear as spikes in the chart on the weather tab), you may need to adjust the thresholds.

## Travelling altitude change threshold

You should start by adjusting the travelling altitude change threshold, which represents maximum altitude change which you would consider the same location. If your altitude changes more than this threshold, you will be considered travelling. It will take an hour of readings within the threshold to no longer be considered travelling. Adjust this value until the spike on the chart is almost gone. An easier way to do this will be created in the future.

## Ignore rapid altitude changes

To ignore readings while travelling, enable the "ignore rapid altitude changes" setting. You may want to enable this because readings taken while changing altitude may cause inaccurate weather predictions.

## Factoring in rapid pressure changes

Sometimes the GPS may not be able to detect an altitude change, but there is a large spike in pressure correlated to the change. In this case, you can enable the "factor in rapid pressure changes" setting and adjust the threshold to a bit over the maximum pressure change you see with storms in your area.
