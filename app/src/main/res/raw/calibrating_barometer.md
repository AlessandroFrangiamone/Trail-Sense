To calibrate your barometer to sea level, first open the barometer settings (Trail Sense Settings > Barometer and thermometer), then enable sea level pressure. Also, ensure that your altimeter is properly calibrated (Trail Sense Settings > Altimeter), as incorrect elevations will cause incorrect sea level conversions.

There are several settings which you can use to get a more accurate sea level pressure reading. Every phone is different, and it may also be different based on where you are hiking (ex. mountain vs a flat plain).

## Elevation outlier removal
GPS elevations aren't very consistent, therefore you may see spikes in elevation readings. Decreasing the elevation outlier removal threshold will make Trail Sense more aggressive in removing spikes in elevation.

## Elevation smoothing
Increasing the elevation smoothing will reduce the noise present in GPS elevation readings when you are not moving, but smoothing it too much may cause Trail Sense to ignore real elevation changes.

## Pressure smoothing
Increasing the pressure smoothing will reduce the noise present in pressure readings, but smoothing it too much may cause Trail Sense to ignore real pressure changes.

## Factor in temperature
Factoring in the temperature will give a more accurate pressure reading to what local stations report, but make it prone to noise from your phone's thermometer.
