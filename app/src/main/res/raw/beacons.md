# Before your trip
It is best to enter beacons into Trail Sense while you still have Internet, so you can use the beacons to navigate while on the trail. Do this by opening locations from a map app in Trail Sense, or by manually entering the coordinates.

# On the trail
While on the trail, it is best to place beacons on prominent features or forks in the trail. Adding a comment may be helpful if you need to follow a trail of beacons back.

When navigating to a beacon, head in its general direction (routing around obstacles or staying on the trail).
