Using the Light Meter tool, you can test the beam distance of flashlights, and get a sense for how well you'll be able to see at night.

1. In a dark or dimly lit room, open the Light Meter tool
2. Enter the distance you will hold your flashlight away from your phone (ex. 3 feet, 1 meter) - don't stand too close, as your phone has a maximum brightness it can detect
3. Turn on your flashlight and point at the light sensor of your phone (normally right above the screen)
4. Move your flashlight around the front of your phone a little (maintaining the distance) so Trail Sense can determine what the maximum strength of the beam is.
5. Turn off your flashlight and view the beam distance
6. Click "RESET" when done to test another flashlight

## Determining what beam distance you need

The beam distance shown in Trail Sense should roughly match the beam distance on the flashlight's packaging. This means that at the beam distance, things will be illuminated about the same as on a night with a full moon, which is the minimum safe hiking light level. For reading a map, a shorter beam distance is recommended and for hiking a larger beam distance is recommended. If you can, experiment with a few flashlights at night to determine what beam distance is best for you.
