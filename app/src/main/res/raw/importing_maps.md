## How to create a map?

To use maps in Trail Sense, you must enable the "Photo Maps" setting in Trail Sense's "Experimental" settings. Note that the Photo Maps are not finished at this point, so don't use it for important decisions and always have a backup map. Email me at trailsense@protonmail.com with any crashes, bug reports, or feedback.

From the "Photo Maps" tool, tap the plus button the the bottom right, and choose how you want to import your map. Give it a name, outline the map in the photo, and then rotate it so North is pointed up. Now the map is ready to be calibrated.

CalTopo is a great source for downloading high quality trail maps, which are easy to calibrate in Trail Sense. Just 'print' the map to a Geospatial PDF and Trail Sense can automatically import it and calibrate.

## How to calibrate a map?

Once a map is imported, you will need to calibrate it using two known points.

### With beacons

If you have entered beacons within the bounds of the map, you can tap the map where your beacon is, then select the beacon using the coordinate input field.

### On the trail

You can use distinct features on the trail to identify your location on the map, such as river crossings, trail intersections, or trail maps (with the 'you are here' marker). Once you have located your current position on the map, tap it and use the coordinate input field to select your current GPS location.

If you took a picture of the trail sign and are using that, you can mark you current location (if the 'you are here' marker is present), then walk to the next trail intersection or feature along your way and mark that, which will then plot your position onto the map.

### From the map grid

If you took a picture of a printed map or downloaded a map online (ex. CalTopo), you can use the grid lines on the map to calculate the location of several features, and enter them into Trail Sense by tapping on them on the map and entering their grid coordinates. See the 'Using printed maps' guide for how to get coordinates from a map.

The intersection points between gridlines are the easiest to calibrate off of.

### From an online source

If you have Internet access, you can look up the coordinates of map feature and tap them in Trail Sense and enter the coordinates.
