The Photo Map feature allows you to use a photo as a map in Trail Sense. Always carry a physical map for backup and verify the accuracy of Trail Sense.

## How to create a photo map?

1. On the Tools tab, click Photo Maps
2. Tap the plus button on the bottom right and choose how you want to import your map
    - **Camera** - Take a picture of your map, making sure to include the entire map in the picture
    - **File** - Select a file from your device (JPG, PNG, or PDF)
    - **Blank** - Create a blank map given a location and the size of the map - useful if you have paths or beacons created
3. Crop the photo to the map bounds
4. Calibrate the map using 2 known locations:
    - Enter the real-world location in the input field. For example, a trail sign, fork, or point of interest.
    - Tap the map where the location is
    - Use Previous/Next to switch between calibration points.
    - You can click Next + Done to save the calibration at any time.
5. Tap Done to save the calibration and use the map

**Note**: If you choose to use a blank map or Geospatial PDF, your map will automatically be calibrated. A good source for Geospatial PDFs is [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com).

## Calibration point tips

### Calibrating while hiking
- Point 1: This point should the trail sign where you took the photo of the map or the trailhead.
- Point 2: This point should be the first trail fork you encounter. If you don't encounter a trail fork, use a point of interest on the map (ex. a lake, peak, or other landmark).

### From the map grid
If your map has gridlines, you can follow the 'Using printed maps' guid to get the coordinates of several features on the map and enter them into Trail Sense.

The intersection points between gridlines are the easiest to calibrate from.

### From an online source

If you have Internet access, you can look up the coordinates of a map feature. Then in Trail Sense, tap the same location on the map and enter the coordinates.
