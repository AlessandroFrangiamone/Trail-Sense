## How to create a map?

From the 'Offline Maps' tool, tap the plus button in the bottom right and give your map a name. You will then be prompted to select an image of a map. At this time, the image must already exist on your phone, so you may need to have downloaded a map image or taken a picture already. Only image files are supported at this point (i.e. no PDFs), this will change in the future. After selecting a map you can open it from the list and calibrate it.

Caltopo is a great source for downloading high quality trail maps, which are easy to calibrate in Trail Sense. Just 'print' the map to a JPG with UTM gridlines on, and import it into Trail Sense on your phone, then calibrate using the grid lines.

**Maps must be flat and with True North pointing up**

## How to calibrate a map?

Once a map has been imported, you can calibrate by selecting two known points and entering their real world location.

### With beacons

If you have entered beacons within the bounds of the map, you can tap the map where your beacon is, then select the beacon using the coordinate input field.

### On the trail

You can use distinct features on the trail to identify your location on the map, such as river crossings, trail intersections, or trail maps (with the 'you are here' marker). Once you have located your current position on the map, tap it and use the coordinate input field to select your current GPS location.

If you took a picture of the trail sign and are using that, you can mark you current location (if the 'you are here' marker is present), then walk to the next trail intersection or feature along your way and mark that, which will then plot your position onto the map.

### From the map grid

If you took a picture of a printed map or downloaded a map online (ex. Caltopo), you can use the grid lines on the map to calculate the location of several features, and enter them into Trail Sense by tapping on them on the map and entering their grid coordinates. See the 'Using printed maps' guide for how to get coordinates from a map.

The intersection points between gridlines are the easiest to calibrate off of.

### From an online source

If you have Internet access, you can look up the coordinates of map feature and tap them in Trail Sense and enter the coordinates.
