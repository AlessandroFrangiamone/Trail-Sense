The Cliff Height tool can be used to estimate the height of a cliff.

## Estimating Height

1. Ensure the area below the cliff is safe (no risk of landslide or people/animals).
2. Drop a small rock or similar object down the cliff while holding the measure button.
3. Release the button when the object hits the bottom.
4. The height of the cliff will display at the top of the screen.

## Disclaimer

You are responsible for ensuring you use this tool in a safe manner, please only use when it is safe to do so, and do not stand too close to the cliff.
