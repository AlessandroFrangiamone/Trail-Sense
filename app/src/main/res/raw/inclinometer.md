## Determining avalanche risk

Most avalanches occur on slopes between 30 and 50 degrees. You can use the inclinometer feature in Trail Sense by holding your phone sideways (so the spine of your phone is facing up), and putting it up to your eye. You can then align the spine of your phone with the top of the slope and tap anywhere on the screen to lock the angle. Trail Sense will then report the level of avalanche risk.

## Use common sense

Trail Sense uses a general rule of thumb to determine if a slope has avalanche potential, which is limited by your phone's sensors. If you think a slope is unsafe, then try to find an alternate route to avoid it or take precautions.

## Estimating the height of objects

1. Enter the distance you are to the base of the object
2. Enter your height
3. Hold the fine sideways with the spine facing up and put it up to your eye
4. Align the spine of the phone with the top of the object and tap the screen to lock the angle
5. The estimated height of the object will be shown at the top of the screen
