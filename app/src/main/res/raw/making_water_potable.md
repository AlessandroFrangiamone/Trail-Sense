## How to make water safe to drink?

First you need to find a source of water, preferably moving and clear. Once you obtain water, you will need to filter it using tightly woven cloth, charcoal, or a water filter. In a metal pot or canteen, bring the water to a boil.

Once the water is at a rolling boil, you can open Trail Sense's Water Boil Timer tool, and wait for it to get an altitude fix. Once your altitude is determined, you can click the start button and once the timer has expired your water is most likely safe to drink.

Note: The time required for boiling water to make it safe to drink varies by altitude. Below 1000 meters it is 1 minute and above is 3 minutes.
