## How to track how far you've travelled?

By default, the odometer will use Backtrack and any time you open Trail Sense to track your distance travelled. You can use this to get a rough estimate of distance travelled, but it will not work well for trails which zig-zag, and will include distance travelled by car or bike.

For a better estimate, you can switch the Odometer source to 'Pedometer' under the 'Odometer' settings. You will need to grant the Activity Recognition permission to use this, and it will run as an always active notification. The pedometer will be more accuracy than the GPS while you are walking, but may drain more battery depending on your phone (some phones draw very little power with the pedometer, please test this before you go on a hike).

### Determining stride length

To obtain the best accuracy, you must calibrate the pedometer via the 'Stride length' setting. To do this, mark out a known distance on the ground (ex. 10 meters) and walk it, counting every step. The stride length you enter will be the distance you marked divided by the number of steps you took.

## How to calibrate the ETA for beacons using the speedometer?

The speedometer is used to determine the time it takes to reach a beacon, and the source of this can be configured in the Navigation settings. If you have Backtrack enabled, the average speed will provide more consistent ETAs, as it uses the speed between Backtrack readings. The instantaneous speed uses the GPS reported speed, which may vary every GPS reading.
