Backtrack can be used to record waypoints while hiking, and if lost you can navigate back to your last known position without needing to set up beacons before hiking.

## Enabling Backtrack

You can enable Backtrack by clicking the quick action button in the top left of the navigation tab or under the Location section in Tools. Once on the Backtrack page, you can click the start button in the bottom right to turn it on. It will stay on until you disable it by clicking the same button. You can change the waypoint placing interval in Trail Sense Settings > Tools.

## Using Backtrack

Once Backtrack is enabled, you can open the tool by clicking the quick action button in the top left of the navigation tab or under the Location section in Tools. You should see a list of waypoints, which represent your position at a specific time. From there, you can tap on a waypoint to start navigation, or you can click the menu button to either create a beacon from it or delete it. It is recommended that you create a beacon from the waypoint and use that to navigate, as waypoints will only be available for 2 days before being deleted forever.

Using the cell signal strength readings, you can navigate back to a location where you had a cell signal if needed. The network shown is the one with the best signal strength which your phone is registered to.

**Note:** Backtrack will not run when using lower power mode in Trail Sense
