The Battery tool can be used to monitor battery consumption.

## Time Until Charged / Dead
The Battery tool will give an estimate (based on the last day's history) of how long it will take for your phone to die or become fully charged. The actual time may vary with use.

## Battery Statistics
The battery indicator shows the current battery percentage and if supported, the remaining capacity (in mAh). Below that, you can see how fast your device is currently charging or discharging. Additionally, if your battery health is poor, you will see a warning.

## Battery History
You can see the history of battery percentage by clicking the chart icon in the top right corner. This shows the last day's history, as recorded by Trail Sense.

## System Settings
To view system battery settings and usage, click the settings icon in the top right corner.

## Power Saving Mode
Turning on 'Power saving mode' will reduce the power consumption of Trail Sense by stopping some services, such as Backtrack and Weather, as well as using the black theme. You can turn this on using the 'Power saving mode' switch on the battery tool.

You can configure power saving mode to turn on automatically when your battery is low by opening Settings > Power > Enable 'Automatic power saving'.

## Services
Running services are listed below the battery statistics. You can see how often they are running and how impactful they are on battery life. You can stop a service by clicking the 'X' button next to it.

## Quick Action
The Power Saving Mode quick action is available on any tab. You can enable the quick action in the settings for the tab you want it on.

To use the quick action, tap the power saving mode quick action button to toggle it on or off.

## Additional Tips
- Enable your phone's battery saver mode
- Reduce screen brightness
- Turn on airplane mode (you won't be able to receive calls/texts)
- Turn off your screen when not in use
