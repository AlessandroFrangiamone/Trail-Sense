## How to create a beacon

You can follow these steps to create a beacon, with the exception of creating a beacon from a maps application - for that you will start by opening the maps app and sharing a location to Trail Sense.

1. On the navigation tab, click the navigation button (bottom right corner)
2. Click the create beacon button (bottom right corner)
3. Click "Beacon"
4. Enter the name of the beacon (of your choosing)
5. Enter the latitude or longitude (see below)
6. Optionally add the beacon to an existing group
7. Enter the elevation or notes (optional)
8. Click the done button (this only appears when a valid name, latitude, and longitude are entered)

## From your current location

On the drop beacon page, you can click "USE CURRENT LOCATION" to drop a beacon at your current location.

## From a known latitude and longitude

On the drop beacon page, you can enter the latitude and longitude of a known location. The supported formats are decimal degrees (ex. -77.508333), degrees decimal minutes (ex. 77°30.5' S), and degrees minutes seconds (ex. 77°30'29.9988" S). Only the English characters are supported for DDM and DMS formats (ex. N E S W).

## From a map application

Some map applications allow you to share a location on the map in latitude, longitude format (may be shown as a "geo:" share option). If you share a location and Trail Sense appears in the share options, it will then open the drop beacon tab with the latitude and longitude prefilled.

Unfortunately, Google Maps does not allow sharing location to other apps (it instead shares a link to Google Maps, which Trail Sense can't get latitude and longitude from). A workaround in Google Maps is to find the location you want to create a beacon at, then put your phone into airplane mode. You can then tap and hold the location in Google Maps to place a marker. The title of the marker is the latitude and longitude which you can manually enter into Trail Sense.

## At a distance

To place a beacon a known distance and direction from a location, you can fill out the latitude and longitude fields (the starting location), then toggle the "Create at distance" field on. You will then need to enter the distance away and set the direction to the new location before you can save the beacon. The new beacon will be placed at the distance and direction away from the latitude and longitude entered.
