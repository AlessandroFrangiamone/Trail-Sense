The Clock tool can be used to determine the current time using the GPS satellites.

## Viewing the GPS Time
When you open the Clock tool it will initially be the current time from your device's clock. Once you have a GPX fix, the time will be updated to match the GPS time.

If you want to refresh the time from the GPS, click the refresh button in the top right corner.

## Updating the System Time
To sync your device's clock with the GPS time:

1. Click the 'Update System Time' button.
2. Take note of the time mentioned in the dialog that appears, then click 'OK'. 
3. You will automatically be brought to your device's time settings.
4. Enter the time you were told to set your device's clock to and wait for the clock sync notification before saving.
4. As soon as you see the notification, save the time.
5. Your device's clock is now synced with GPS time.
