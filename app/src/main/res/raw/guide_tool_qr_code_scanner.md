The QR Code Scanner tool can be used to scan QR codes.

## Scanning a QR Code
To scan a QR code, just point your camera at the code. Once it is recognized, the contents will be displayed on your screen with some actions you can take.

### Location
If the QR code contains a location, you will have the following actions:
- **Beacon**: Create a beacon using the location. This will open the Beacon tool with the location pre-filled.
- **Maps**: Open the location in a map app on your phone.
- **Copy**: Copy the contents of the QR code to your clipboard.
- **Delete**: Delete the result from the list.

### URL
If the QR code contains a URL, you will have the following actions:
- **Open**: Open the URL in your default browser.
- **Copy**: Copy the contents of the QR code to your clipboard.
- **Delete**: Delete the result from the list.

### Text
If the QR code contains text or is an unsupported type, you will have the following actions:
- **Note**: Create a note with the text. This will create a note and display a banner at the bottom of the screen with a button to the note.
- **Copy**: Copy the contents of the QR code to your clipboard.
- **Delete**: Delete the result from the list.

## Sharing Data with QR Codes
