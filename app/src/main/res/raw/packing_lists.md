Using packing lists can help you remember to pack all needed items for a trip. You can also use packing lists to estimate and reduce the weight of your pack.

## Creating a packing list

Open the "Packing Lists" tool and click the add button in the bottom right corner, then give the pack a name. This will open the pack and allow you to add items.

Alternatively, you can copy an existing packing list if you want a starting point. After copying, you can use the menu on the top right of the packing list to clear packed amounts if needed.

## Adding items to a packing list

With a packing list open, click the add button in the bottom right corner. On the create item screen, fill out the fields as described below:

- Name: The name of the item
- Packed amount: The number of items currently packed, can be blank or a decimal
- Desired amount: The number of items you would like to pack, can be blank or a decimal
- Category: The category to group this item by, defaults to "Other"
- Weight: The weight of 1 item in your desired units. Trail Sense will scale this by the amount of packed items to determine total weight.

When finished, click the done button in the bottom right corner.

## Packing items

While you collect and pack items into your bag, use the checkbox next to each item to mark it as fully packed - it will set the packed amount to the desired amount and update the weight. Alternatively, you can click the menu next to an item to add or subtract a specific amount or edit it to set the exact amount packed.

While marking items as packed, the packed percent will update and total weight of the pack. The units of the total weight can be changed in the "Units" section of Trail Sense's Settings.

## Sorting

Clicking the menu on the top right of the packing list will allow you to sort your items.

- Category: This groups items by category and sorts by name within the category
- Percent packed (low to high): Items which are unpacked show at the top, while packed items move to the bottom. Use this to more easily see what is left to pack.
- Percent packed (high to low):Items which are packed show at the top, while unpacked items move to the bottom. Use this to more easily see what is already packed.
- Weight (low to high): Items which take up less weight in your pack sort to the top.
- Weight (high to low): Items which take up more weight in your pack sort to the top. Use this to see which items are weighing down your pack.
