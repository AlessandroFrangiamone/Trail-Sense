# Navigate using the sun / moon
Start navigating using Trail Sense and note the direction to the beacon in relation to the sun - it may be helpful to enable the "show sun/moon on compass" setting. 

Once you have that noted, you can close Trail Sense and use the sun to navigate. For best results, check in Trail Sense every 10 to 15 minutes. 

Example:
1. Start navigating to beacon
2. The direction to the beacon is West and the sun is directly South
3. You can close Trail Sense and walk with the sun to your left

# Navigate using landmarks
Start navigating using Trail Sense and find a landmark / prominent feature in the direction of the beacon which you can walk to. You can then close Trail Sense and restart navigation once you arrive at the landmark.

# Disable weather monitoring
You can disable weather monitoring in settings to conserve battery life. If you need weather monitoring, there are a few options available:
- Decrease update frequency
- Disable "force weather updates" (will not run on low battery)
- Use the pressure setpoint instead (long press the pressure on the weather tab), and set a new setpoint every 3 hours

# Use the black theme
Setting the theme to "black" in settings may reduce the power consumption on some phones.

# Use your phone's power saving features
- Enable battery saver mode
- Reduce screen brightness
- Turn on airplane mode (you won't be able to receive calls/texts)
- Turn off your screen when not in use
