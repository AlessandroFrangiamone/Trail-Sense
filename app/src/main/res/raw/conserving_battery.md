## How to monitor power consumption?

You can use the Battery tool in Trail Sense to monitor battery consumption. This tool will tell you if you battery is discharging fast or slow (on some devices), which you can use to adjust your phone usage, which apps are running, or screen brightness. When you plug in a charger, it will also tell you how fast your phone is charging, which you can use to determine if your charger is effective. You can also see which Trail Sense services are running and their respective battery usage factor.

Trail Sense will also give an estimate (based on the last day's history) of how long it will take for your phone to die or become fully charged. The actual time may vary with use.

## Power saving mode

Turning on 'Power saving mode' will reduce the power consumption of Trail Sense by stopping some services, such as Backtrack and Weather, as well as using the black theme. You can turn this on in setting or on the 'Battery' tool.

## Navigate using the sun / moon

Start navigating using Trail Sense and note the direction to the beacon in relation to the sun - it may be helpful to enable the "show sun/moon on compass" setting.

Once you have that noted, you can close Trail Sense and use the sun to navigate. For best results, check in Trail Sense every 10 to 15 minutes.

Example:

1. Start navigating to beacon
2. The direction to the beacon is West and the sun is directly South
3. You can close Trail Sense and walk with the sun to your left

## Navigate using landmarks

Start navigating using Trail Sense and find a landmark / prominent feature in the direction of the beacon which you can walk to. You can then close Trail Sense and restart navigation once you arrive at the landmark.

## Disable weather monitoring

You can disable weather monitoring in settings to conserve battery life. If you need weather monitoring, there are a few options available:

- Decrease update frequency
- Disable weather monitor and open the weather tab to log every couple hours

## Use the black theme

Setting the theme to "black" in settings may reduce the power consumption on some phones.

## Use your phone's power saving features

- Enable battery saver mode
- Reduce screen brightness
- Turn on airplane mode (you won't be able to receive calls/texts)
- Turn off your screen when not in use
