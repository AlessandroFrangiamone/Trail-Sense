The pedometer can be used to measure distance based on how many steps you take. On most phones, this sensor does not draw much power, but your experience may vary.

## How to calibrate the pedometer?
Before using the pedometer in Trail Sense, you should calibrate it based on your stride length. Your stride length is measured as the distance travelled with a single step. To set your stride length, you can open Trail Sense Settings > Sensors > Pedometer and provide a value for stride length. You can use Trail Sense to estimate this value by doing the following:

1. From the Pedometer settings, click "Estimate stride length"
2. Ensure you are outside, have a clear view of the sky, have a straight path where you can walk at least 50 steps, and are wearing your hiking gear
3. Press start and sand still until Trail Sense tells you to walk
4. Start walking in a straight line - you can put your phone in your pocket or by your side as you walk
5. When you are done, stand still for a little (for best results), then press stop
6. You can then choose to save the stride length

## How to measure distance travelled?
When you want to measure distance, open the Pedometer tool and click the start button in the lower right corner of the screen. You may be prompted to grant the "physical activity" permission, which will allow Trail Sense to read your phone's pedometer. You can then put your phone away and begin your hike. You can open the Pedometer tool at any point to check how far you've travelled since starting the pedometer. You can stop the pedometer at any point (ex. while resting or at a campsite), and resume it by clicking start again. If you want to start a new measurement, you can click the reset button on the Pedometer tool.

## How to measure walking speed?
With the pedometer on, you can see the average speed since the last reset or your current speed (over the last 10 seconds). These speeds are based on your steps and do not factor in breaks yet.

## How to set a distance alert?
If the pedometer is on, you can choose to receive a notification when you've reached a certain distance travelled. Just open the Pedometer tool and click the alert icon in the top right, then set the distance you want to be alerted at. You can use the alert to remind you to take a break after a certain distance has been travelled or to become more aware of an upcoming fork in the trail or other point of interest. Note: If you want to be alerted in 1 km from now, you can either reset the distance before setting "1 km", or by setting "1 km + your current distance" as the distance alert. For example, if you've travelled 4 km and want to be notified in 1 km more, set the alert to 5 km.
