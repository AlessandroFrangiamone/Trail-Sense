## Calling or texting

### Why is having a cell phone signal important?

Having a cell phone signal will allow you to contact emergency services or check in with others. For this reason, bring your phone on every hike.

### How to signal for help when you have a weak or no signal?

In the United States and several other countries, you can call emergency services (ex. 911) even if you don't have a signal through your provider - you'll still have to have a signal through at least one provider though. This may allow emergency services to triangulate your position and send help. Be sure to memorize your local emergency number. Some places may also allow you to text emergency services if a phone call can't go through - it may require registration, so be sure to look up local instructions prior to hiking.

If you are checking in with someone, try both a text message and phone call - as one may go through. Some phones will also send text messages when you get a signal. If possible, include your latitude and longitude (from the Navigation tab) in the message so people know where you last were if an emergency happens.

### How to find the last time you had a signal?

If you have 'Backtrack' and 'Record cell signal' enabled (Navigation settings), then the quality and type of your cell signal is recorded on the Backtrack tab. You can use this to navigate back to the last location where you had a cell signal. Be advised, that Trail Sense records what your phone reports, which may not be a completely accurate representation of cell phone signal connection quality.
