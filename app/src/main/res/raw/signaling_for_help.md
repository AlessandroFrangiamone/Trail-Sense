    ## Calling or texting

    ### Why is having a cell phone signal important?

    Having a cell phone signal will allow you to contact emergency services or check in with others. For this reason, bring your phone on every hike.

    ### How to signal for help when you have a weak or no signal?

    In the United States and several other countries, you can call emergency services (ex. 911) even if you don't have a signal through your provider - you'll still have to have a signal through at least one provider though. This may allow emergency services to triangulate your position and send help. Be sure to memorize your local emergency number. Some places may also allow you to text emergency services if a phone call can't go through - it may require registration, so be sure to look up local instructions prior to hiking.

    If you are checking in with someone, try both a text message and phone call - as one may go through. Some phones will also send text messages when you get a signal. If possible, include your latitude and longitude (from the Navigation tab) in the message so people know where you last were if an emergency happens.

    ### How to find the last time you had a signal?

    If you have 'Backtrack' and 'Record cell signal' enabled (Navigation settings), then the quality and type of your cell signal is recorded on the Backtrack tab. You can use this to navigate back to the last location where you had a cell signal. Be advised, that Trail Sense records what your phone reports, which may not be a completely accurate representation of cell phone signal connection quality.

    ## Flashlight

    ### How to signal for help with a flashlight?

    The 'SOS' signal pattern is a well known distress signal for rescue operators.

    From Trail Sense, you can open the 'Flashlight' tool and click the 'SOS' button. You can turn your screen off to save battery, but the flashlight will quickly drain it, so be aware.

    If your phone does not have a flashlight or if you would like to save it's battery for other uses (like calling for help), you can use a flashlight or headlamp. Some flashlights have a built in SOS mode, so use that if available. If you do it manually, the sequence is:

    on off on off on off long-on off long-on off long-on off on off on off on off repeat

    or in morse code

    ...---...

    Where on is about 3 times shorter than the long-on and off is about the same length of on. It doesn't matter if your timing is exact, just enough to tell the difference between the flashes.

    Flashlight signals are best seen at night, and flashlights with the longest beam distance are visible further away (see the 'Determine flashlight effectiveness' guide).

    ## Whistle

    ### How to signal for help with a whistle?

    Three short bursts of the whistle are a well known distress signal.

    From Trail Sense, you can open the 'Whistle' tool and click the 'Help' button (alternatively click the 'SOS' button). This will play a whistle sound while you have the whistle tool open. For best results, turn your volume up to max or connect to an external speaker. Trail Sense can only play a sound as loud as your phone's speakers allow, so it is always best to carry an emergency whistle with you.

    ## Other ways to signal for help

    - Signal fire
    - Shouting
    - Signal mirror (you may be able to use your phone screen for this in a pinch, but a mirror is much better)
    - Hand signals
    - Crafted signals (ex. bright colored tarp or an SOS made out of sticks)
